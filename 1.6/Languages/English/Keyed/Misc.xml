    <USH_HE_CyberspaceLetter>{PAWN} with an installed cyberlink started hacking {BUILDING}, which is protected by {HACKSET}. It means that the hacker is now vulnerable to new cyberthreats and can trigger special security responses with a chance depending on the hacker’s stealth.\n\nColonists not connected to cyberspace by a link will not be affected, so you should always consider who is hacking devices with more advanced and possibly lethal security hacksets.\n\nAnd remember: there is no spoon.</USH_HE_CyberspaceLetter>
