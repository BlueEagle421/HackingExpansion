## Overview

> [!NOTE]
> **Hacking Expansion** introduces a fully integrated cybersecurity gameplay layer for RimWorld, expanding player interaction with electronic systems while maintaining vanilla balance and mod compatibility.

Players gain the ability to **hack turrets, mechanoids, and data sources** through a structured progression path that evolves from basic cyberware implants into advanced cyberspace operations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The mod is designed with **modularity, extensibility, and interoperability** as first-class concerns, ensuring compatibility with both vanilla RimWorld and heavily modded environments.

---

## Purpose and Scope

> [!TIP]
> Hacking Expansion is built to scale in complexity alongside the player’s technological progression.

The mod introduces a **layered hacking ecosystem** that integrates naturally into RimWorld gameplay:

- **Early game** — Physical cyberware and local hacking
- **Mid game** — Protected data extraction and security countermeasures
- **Late game** — Remote cyberspace operations and executable hacking programs

---

## Core Gameplay Concepts

Hacking Expansion is structured around several tightly coupled concepts that together form the core gameplay loop.

### Hackers

> [!NOTE]
> Hacking capabilities are pawn-driven and require explicit cybernetic investment.

Pawns equipped with **cyberlink implants** gain the ability to remotely interact with electronic systems.

- Serves as the foundation for all hacking interactions
- Enables both local and remote operations

---

### Data Ripping

> [!WARNING]
> Extracting data is never risk-free.

**Data Ripping** is the process of extracting cyberdata from hackable entities.

- Actively triggers defensive systems
- Produces data used for research, progression, and exec abilities

---

### Security Hacksets

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Higher-value data is always more dangerous to extract.

Tiered defensive systems protect valuable data sources.

- Can trigger harmful outcomes
- Examples include neural damage, system backlash, and cyberspace coma

---

### Exec Abilities

> [!TIP]
> Exec abilities reward specialization and long-term planning.

Advanced executable programs learned over time.

- Unlock powerful, specialized hacking actions
- Represent the player’s mastery of cyber operations

---

### Cyberspace

> [!NOTE]
> Cyberspace represents the endgame of hacking progression.

A virtual state entered via cyberpods.

- Enables long-range hacking
- Reduces physical risk
- Introduces late-game strategic depth

---

## Player Progression Flow

> [!NOTE]
> Complexity is introduced gradually to avoid overwhelming new players.

Player interaction follows a clear progression:

1. Cyberlink installation  
2. Basic hacking attempts  
3. Data extraction under security pressure  
4. Exec ability acquisition  
5. Cyberspace-based remote hacking  

This ensures a smooth transition from hands-on hacking to advanced cyber warfare.

---

## RimWorld Integration Strategy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The mod never modifies base game files.

Hacking Expansion integrates cleanly with RimWorld through the following mechanisms:

### Static XML Definitions

- Standard RimWorld content pipelines
- Items, hediffs, abilities, and buildings
- Fully compatible with existing mod frameworks

### Harmony Patching

> [!NOTE]
> Runtime patching allows seamless extension of vanilla content.

- Injects hacking capabilities into vanilla turrets and mechanoids
- No base-game file modification
- High compatibility with other mods

---

## World Content Generation

> [!TIP]
> World content reinforces hacking as a core exploration mechanic.

The mod adds new discoverable content to the world:

| Content            | Generation Method | Purpose                   |
|--------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Ancient Cyberdecks | Map generation   | Early-game data sources   |
| Data Centers       | World scattering | Mid-game challenges       |
| Black Boxes        | Event-driven     | Late-game faction content |
| Encrypted Crates   | Loot tables      | Exec data rewards         |

All world content integrates directly with the hacking system.

> [!NOTE]
> Each subsystem is documented independently for ease of reference.

Each major subsystem includes detailed documentation covering:

- Implementation details
- API contracts
- Modder extension points
